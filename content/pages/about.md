Hi, I'm Renzo. I'm currently a software engineer at [edX](https://www.edx.org/), based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

I graduated from Harvard in 2014 with a degree in computer science. I'm interested in software development and data visualization. I enjoy [cooking](https://github.com/rlucioni/recipes), soccer, and squash.
