Hi, I'm Renzo. I like helping people learn new stuff, usually with code and English. I'm currently a software engineer at [edX](https://www.edx.org/), based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

I graduated from Harvard in 2014 with a degree in computer science. I'm interested in software development and data visualization. I enjoy cooking, weight training, and playing video games like Civilization V.

If you'd like to know more about me, take a look at <a class="resume" href="{filename}../pdfs/renzo-lucioni-resume.pdf" data-resume-id="pdf" data-no-instant>my resume</a>.
