This is the source for a static site generated with [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/).

To generate the site's CSS, run `make css`. This processes the included Sass files and outputs minified CSS.

To generate the site's HTML, run `make html`. This invokes Pelican, which uses the settings defined in `pelicanconf.py` and the included Jinja2 templates to produce the site's static pages.
