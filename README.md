# Pelican Site

This is the source for my personal web site, [www.renzolucioni.com](http://www.renzolucioni.com/). It's generated using [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican), a static site generator written in Python, in combination with a custom theme I created using Jinja2 templates and Sass. I've been able to easily extend Pelican to do things like building sitemaps and linking to related content at the end of posts.

## Getting Started

Management commands used to develop and publish the site are implemented as `make` targets, several built on top of the Pelican CLI. To make a new post, execute

```
$ make post TITLE='Your Title Here'
```

A slug for the new post is automatically generated by transforming the provided title. All non-alphanumeric characters are replaced with hyphens, repeated hyphens are squeezed into a single hyphen, and all remaining characters are lowercased. Other post metadata like author name (my name) and creation date is automatically populated, along with placeholders for other metadata like tags and a description of the post which becomes the post's `meta` description.

To generate the site's CSS, run

```
$ make css
``` 

This processes the included Sass files and outputs minified CSS. To generate the site's HTML during development, run

```
$ make html
```

This invokes Pelican, which uses the settings defined in `configuration/dev.py` and the included Jinja2 templates to produce the site's static pages. To serve the site at `http://localhost:8000`, run

```
$ make serve
```

To perform all three steps at once, run

```
$ make fresh
```

To generate the site using production settings and publish it to GitHub Pages, run

```
$ make github
```

## Configuration

Configuration details are stored in Python modules. This allows me to have my production configuration inherit from a base set of development settings.

To configure the site for production, create a file for the target production environment in the `configuration` directory. My site is hosted on GitHub Pages, and my personal configuration is at `configuration/github.py`. This module is consumed when running `make publish`, which generates the site using production settings. The production settings module should be used to import and override values from `configuration/dev.py`. At a minimum, the module should contain something like the following:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

from __future__ import unicode_literals

import os
import sys

# https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/issues/406
sys.path.append(os.curdir)

from configuration.dev import *


SITEURL = 'http://www.renzolucioni.com'
DELETE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = True
RELATIVE_URLS = False
```

## Performance

My site is hosted on GitHub Pages. I've attempted to reduce latency by using [InstantClick](https://github.com/dieulot/instantclick) to preload pages, as well as [FastClick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick) to remove click delays in browsers with touch UIs.

My logo is a 529 byte SVG which I designed in [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/), inspired by the work of [Tom Geismar](http://tomgeismar.com/). Images are all compressed using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).

The web fonts used by the site &ndash; Roboto and Fira Mono &ndash; are downloaded from Google and bundled with and served alongside the site, and every favicon imaginable was generated with the help of [RealFaviconGenerator](http://realfavicongenerator.net/).
