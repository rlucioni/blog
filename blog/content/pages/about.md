Hi, I'm Renzo. I'm currently a software engineer at <a class="outbound" href="https://logrocket.com">LogRocket</a>, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

I graduated from Harvard in 2014 with a degree in computer science. I'm interested in software development and data visualization. I enjoy <a class="outbound" href="https://github.com/rlucioni/cookbook">cooking</a> and playing <a class="outbound" href="https://github.com/rlucioni/courtbot">squash</a>.

If you'd like to know more about me, take a look at <a href="/resume">my resume</a>.
